Database Replication
--

It refers to sharing information to ensure consistency between multiple database instances. This is to improve reliability,
fault tolerant and accessibility.

Master/Standby Replication
In this type of replication, there is a master node which is the only node that accepts writes and no other instance should
accept write. The other standby or slave instances accept writes from the master node either by sync or async replication
mechanism. The standby or slave nodes act as read replicas and accepts reas from different users.

Multi-Master Replication
In this type of replication, there are more than one master that accept writes. This can create a lot of conflicts and the 
application should be aware of it. Conflict resolution techniques must be used in order to resole such issues when trying to
sync data with each other.

Sync vs Async Replication
In sync replication, the client has to wait until and unless the master and all the standby and salve instances are done with the
commit of the transaction. If there is one master and 10 slaves, then databases like postgres allows a maximum number of sync
instances to be provided. If the value provided is 5 then the client will have to wait until atleast 5 instances are committed
successfuly including the master. This will guarentee full consistency.
In async replication, only the master has to be updated and the client is done. But there will be other backgound tasks running
in order to update all the slaves instances periodically. So this will consume some CPU cycles and effort. It will guarentee
eventual consistency.

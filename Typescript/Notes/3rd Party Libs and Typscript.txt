3rd Party Libs and Typescript
-----------

-Using lodash with typescript which is a popular JS utility librari
..
npm install --save lodash

import _ from 'lodash'
const arr = [1,2,3]
console.log(_.shiffule(arr))

-We will get the output but we will get errors also. Because lodash contains javascript code and 
typesciprt dont know what to do with it. It will also give error to the import statement.
-To get rid of errors, we need to translate this library to be used with typescript
For that
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
As soon as we install this, the errors will be gone.
-With @types we can use almost any popular 3rd party javascript libraries with typescript like
@types/jquery





-What if we want to use the javascript variable inside our ts code
..
-If we have a script file that has var GLOBAL = "Global variable"
-And inside our ts file
..
console.log(GLOBAL) // Error
-It will execute perfectly in the browser but out compiler will complain about it
-We can use the declare keyword to tell typescript that this variable exist and will contain some value
-It is used as we developer know that something will exist
..
declar var GLOBAL: any
console.log(GLOBAL);





Class Transofrmer
-Converting our json objects to map to our class
npm install --save-dev class-transformer
npm install --save-dev reflected-metadata

..
class Product {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  
  constructor(private title: string, private price: number)
}

const dataFromServer = [
  {title: "Book", price: "12.99"}
  {title: "Carpet", price: "10.99"}
]

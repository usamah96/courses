Interface as Function Types
interface AddFn {
  (n1: number, n2: number): number
}

let add: AddFn = function(n1: number, n2: number){ return n1 + n2; }

-Using types as function types are most common and recommended but there is an
alternative to types which we should be aware of
..
type AddFn = (n1: number: n2: number) => number
let add: AddFn = function(n1: number, n2: number){ return n1 + n2; }

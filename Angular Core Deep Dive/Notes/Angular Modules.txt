Angular Modules
---

Angular Module is what is the combination of all the components, directives, pipes that are
tightly coupled together.

Inside the app.modules.ts we have serveral things

1) declarations array which consists of all the components, pipes and directives
2) imports array which consists of 3rd party or internal external modules. The imports contain
the BrowserModule which inside also contains CommonModule. The CommonModule is what we are
capable of using the structural directives like ngFor, ngIf etc.
3) providers array which consists of services to be provided to the application
4) bootstrap array which defines the application root component. The root component can be
multiple that is why it is an array. If there are other root components then add here the
component name and also add the selector in the index.html file aswell.




Feature Module

-Create a module with ng g m course
-This will create a module with the imports array importing the CommonModule
-We will link all the course related components, services and directives here and then import
this module inside our main app.module.ts
..
@NgModule({
  imports: [CommonModule],
  declarations: [CourseCardComponent, CourseImageComponent, HighlightedDirective],
  providers: [CourseService]
})
export class CourseModule{}

-Notice that we wont be able to use this module features until and unless we define the exports
array to tell that whenever this module gets imported, what features you want them to be used
-So in our application we are using the course-card and course-image component we need to
define them in the exports array also

exports: [CourseCardComponent, CourseImageComponent]

-Finally now we can import this module inside the app.module.ts

imports:[..., CourseModule]

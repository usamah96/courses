Building Custom Pipe

-Building a filter pipe that filters courses by category

@Pipe({
  name: 'filterByCategory'
})
export class FilterPipe implements PipeTransform{
  
  transform(courses: Courses[], category: string){
    return courses.filter(course => course.category === category)
  }
}

Usage

<course-card *ngFor="let course of courses | filterByCategory : 'BEGINNER'"></course-card>

-The first arguement is the left hand side on which the pipe is applied and the second arguement
is what on the right hand side.







Pure vs Impure Pipe

-Pure pipe will only get triggered once the input gets changed
-It will not get triggered if the object is being mutated or the change detection is triggered
-As opertaion in pipe is expensive that is why angular wont trigger pipe on every change
detection.

In the above example if we modify one of the Beginner course category to Advanced, we will
see that since the pipe is being filtered to show Beginner courses but one course will be
shown of Advanced category that is just changed which is not what we want because the pipe
wont trigger if we click on a button and change the object property from Beginner to Advanced
as it is a pure pipe by default. We will have to reassign the whole course array only then
the pipe will get triggered.

-In impure pipe, the functionality is triggered on every change detection 
-All we have to do is

@Pipe({
  ...
  pure: false
})

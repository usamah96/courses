Security
--

In our application there are different security concerns.
In our enterprise level application, we need to make sure that,
  .We have the identity of the client 
  .Not everyone should be allowed in our system and only the intended user should be allowed
  .Clients are connecting to correct server
  .Data transmission between and client and server should be confidential and no body should access it over the network
  .Clients should be allowed to do activities for which they have been authorized to
  .Like clients cannot access everything on server, the services should also not be able to access other services for which they are not
   authorized to. Example => catalog-service should not access order-service because there is no need to.
  .Internal data transmission should be secure and should only be accessed by the service for which it is intended to send.
   Example => catalog-service should not be able to access data relevant to auth-service
  .How password are stored in the system like service needs to access database that requires password
  .How does client securely stores tokens that helps accessing the server
  .Client does not authenticate again and again for accessing different parts of system (single sign on)
  .Common security vulneberalities are catered (CSRF, Sql Injection, XSS, etc)

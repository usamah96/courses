Composite
-----

-A mechanism that treats single object or group of objects uniformly
-Treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object

Motivation
..
-Objects use other object's fields and methods through inheritance and composition
-Composition lets us make compound objects
-When you want your clients to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

Example 1
..
The simplest example can be of a company hierarchy. There are managers, team leads, developers etc. We can built a hierarchy
and define which of the employees are under which specific employee using composite design pattern.

Example 2
..
If we look at the video or photo editing software we have options to select shape or graphic shape and then group them
together to become a single object to build something new. This is a simple example of a composite design pattern where we
either treat object in a scaler (singluar) manner or combine multiple objects in a tree like structure to be treated uniformly

Example 3
..
In a neural network we have neurons that are connected with other neurons with incoming and outgoing connections. We also have
a neuron layer which consists of bunch of several neurons. The composite design pattern helps us make a system in which we can
connect a neuron with other neurons, neurons with neuron layer, neuron layer with neurons and neuron layer with other neuron
layers.

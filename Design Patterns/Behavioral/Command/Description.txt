Command
--

You Shall Not Pass

Motivation
--
-Ordinary Java statements are perishable which means that once you assign the value to a variable there is no going back because
nobody saved that previous value
-Cannot undo a field assignment
-Cannot keep track of series of actions or calls to the member functions
-Command can be used to undo/redo operations, macro reading etc...

Example Control Team that wants to have the access to all the operation like turning on and off the light, start and stop
recording the camera.
And the Dashboard that keeps record of all the commands to undo the operation.

Another use case where Command Pattern can come into place is that when we perform any operation like Opening the Db connection,
saving the record into multiple tables, closing the connection etc... So if any of the operation fails we have to rollback
all the commands that are executed.


-Command is an object or group of objects that contains all the information necessary to perform a particulal operation.
-We encapsulate all detail of an operation into a separate object.

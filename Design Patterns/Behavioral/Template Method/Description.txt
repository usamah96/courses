Template Method
---

A high-level blue print for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors.

Motivation
--
-Algorithms can be decomposed into common parts + specifics
-Strategy pattern does this through composition
   .High-level algorithm uses interfaces
   .Concrete implementations implement the interface
-Template method does the same thing through inheritance
   .Overall algorithm makes use of abstract member
   .Inheritor override the abstract members
   .Parent template method invoked.


-Allows us to define the skeleton of the algorithm in the base class with concrete implementaton in the sub-classes

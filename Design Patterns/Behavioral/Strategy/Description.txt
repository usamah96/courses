Strategy
---

System behavior partially specified at runtime

Motivation
--
-Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher and lower level parts
-Example of making tea that can be decomposed into
   .The process of boling the water and pouring into cup
   .Tea-specific things (put teabag, add milk etc..)
-THe high level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot-chocolate.

-With strategy pattern we can define different parts of algorithm for a specific strategy in our system to be executed.

Dynamic Strategy
--
-Ability to change the strategy at runtime based on inputs
-Example of Markdown and Html list item
-Markdown are displayed as *Item1 *Item2 etc...
-Html is displayed as <ul><li>...</li></ul>
-In this apporach we will just use the setStrategy method to change the strategy

Static Strategy
--
-Once the strategy is set, there is no way of changing it.
-We have to use Supplier<T> for it to tell at compile time what strategy to use.

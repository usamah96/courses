  ..
  ..
  @OneToMany

  public void deleteReview(Review r){}
}

public class Review{
  ..
  ..

  private Course course;
}

..

Course c = em.find(Course.class, 1001);

Review r1 = new Review("Review 1");
Review r2 = new Review("Review 2");

em.persist(r1);
em.persist(r2);


-The OnetoMany side of the relationship is by default Lazy Fetch

Encryption and Decryption
--

-Encrypt some of the properties in the configuration properties like password, jwt secret key, exipration time etc...
-2 types are supported
   *Symmetric Eccryption (Shared key)
      .Unique alphanumeric key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt
   *Asymmetric Encryption (RSA Keypair)
      .We have to use keytool command to genrate password protected keystore file
      .This will contain private and public key for encryption and decryption


If Using Java 9 or older Then,
..
-Download and add new libraries to jdk related to cryptography
-Download java jce
-Copy 2 jar files local_policy and US-expert-policy
-Paste them under Java/jdk/jre/lib/security
-Make a backup of these 2 files if already present in the secutiy folder
-Kill all java processes and re run spring boot application to reload the jvm


Add the following property for the encryption key using symmetric encryption
  .encrypt.key=123abc
  .Now hit the following url POST: /encrypt and give string as argument. It will return encrypted result
  .Hit the following url POST: /decrypt and give the encrypted string as argument. It will return decrypted result.
  .Store the value as {cipher}<encrypted-result> and spring will automatically decrypt it.

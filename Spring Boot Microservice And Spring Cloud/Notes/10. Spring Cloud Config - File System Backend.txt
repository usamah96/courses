--

-We can setup a centralized application properties at our local system to be shared by microservices
-Find any suitable location, create a folder and inside it create a properties file
-Give the name to the properties file (must be the config server application name or application.properties)

-Add the following configuration in the config-server application properties file to use the native local system file as a centralized file.
    *spring.profiles.active=native
    *spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations=file:///{full_path}

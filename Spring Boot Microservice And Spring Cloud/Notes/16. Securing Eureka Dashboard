Securing Eureka Dashboard
---

We weill secure our Eureka Discovery Server so that anybody wants to interact needs to provide the username and password

Steps
.
1) Add spring security dependeny on Server service
2) Add properties
    .spring.security.user.name=admin
    .spring.security.user.password=123
3) Create WebSecurity class and extend it with WebSecurityConfigureAdapter
4) Override the configure method and place some http security code in it
5) Head over to eureka end point and see if it prompts for username and password

Now we have register all the clients with eureka using username and password otherwise services will not be registered
We have to set the property that links with eureka including username and password
    .eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://admin:123@localhost:8010/eureka
    
*Make sure to put eureka endpoint property inside a shared property "application.properties" file on config server
*Also save the username and password value to specific discover-service.properties file so that no other service can see it.
*Encrypt the password using config server secret key
